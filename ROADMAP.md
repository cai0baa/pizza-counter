# üçï Pizza Counter App ‚Äî Roadmap

A comprehensive roadmap for upgrading and polishing the Pizza Counter app, focusing on real user value and technical scalability.

---

## **Phase 0: Critical Architecture Fixes** üö® **MUST DO FIRST**

### 1. Component Architecture Refactoring ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**

**Goal:** Break down the monolithic 289-line component into smaller, maintainable pieces.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Extract `ParticipantCard` component
- [ ] Extract `AddParticipantForm` component  
- [ ] Extract `Leaderboard` component
- [ ] Extract `ActionButtons` component
- [ ] Extract custom hooks (`useParticipants`, `useLocalStorage`)
- [ ] Implement proper prop drilling or Context API

**Why:** Current structure is unmaintainable, difficult to test, and violates Single Responsibility Principle.

### 2. Input Validation & Error Handling ‚≠ê **CRITICAL**

**Goal:** Prevent app crashes and data corruption while allowing creative names with numbers and emojis.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add input validation for participant names (length limits, allow numbers/emojis)
- [ ] Implement pizza count limits (prevent negative, set reasonable maximum)
- [ ] Add error boundaries to catch and handle React errors gracefully
- [ ] Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS while preserving emojis/numbers
- [ ] Add subtle form validation feedback

**Why:** App currently crashes with invalid data, but users should be able to use fun names like "Jo√£o üçï" or "Player 1".

### 3. Mobile-First Performance Optimization ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Optimize for smooth mobile/PWA experience with fast touch interactions.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Implement `React.memo` for participant cards (main performance bottleneck)
- [ ] Add `useMemo` for sorting/filtering participants
- [ ] Use `useCallback` for touch event handlers
- [ ] Optimize for mobile rendering (avoid layout thrashing)
- [ ] Add PWA-specific optimizations (service worker caching)
- [ ] Test performance on mid-range mobile devices

**Why:** App will primarily run on mobile devices where performance is more critical than desktop.

### 4. Visual Accessibility üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Ensure good visual accessibility with proper color contrast.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Audit and improve color contrast ratios (WCAG AA compliance)
- [ ] Test readability in bright sunlight (common pizza eating scenario)
- [ ] Ensure button states are clearly visible
- [ ] Add visual focus indicators for touch navigation

**Why:** Users need to see the app clearly in various lighting conditions during pizza competitions.

### 5. TypeScript Migration üü† **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Add type safety to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for Participant and Competition data
- [ ] Migrate components gradually from .jsx to .tsx
- [ ] Add proper typing for all props and state
- [ ] Configure strict TypeScript settings
- [ ] Add type validation for localStorage data

**Why:** No type safety leads to runtime errors, difficult refactoring, poor IDE support.

---

## **Phase 1: Data Reliability & Core Features**

### 1. Local Storage Persistence ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Persist all participant data and counters in the browser so no progress is lost after a page refresh or accidental tab close.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add `useEffect` to load participants from `localStorage` on app initialization
- [ ] Implement automatic saving to `localStorage` whenever participants array changes
- [ ] Handle edge cases (corrupted data, empty storage)
- [ ] Add versioning for data format compatibility

**Code Example:**
```js
// Inside your PizzaCounter component
useEffect(() => {
  const data = localStorage.getItem("pizza_participants");
  if (data) setParticipants(JSON.parse(data));
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem("pizza_participants", JSON.stringify(participants));
}, [participants]);
```

**Why:** Prevents accidental loss of progress and makes the app reliable for users.

### 2. Data Export üü° **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Allow users to export their competition results for sharing and backup.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Export competition data as JSON format
- [ ] Export results as formatted text for sharing
- [ ] Export results as image (winner announcement, leaderboard)
- [ ] Add export button with multiple format options

**Why:** Users want to share and backup competition results, but import is less critical.

### 3. Competition Settings & Rules üü† **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Add configurable rules and limits for different types of competitions.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add competition settings modal (max slices, time limits, penalty rules)
- [ ] Implement competition templates (quick setup for common rules)
- [ ] Add participant limits and constraints
- [ ] Store competition metadata (date, location, type)
- [ ] Add custom scoring rules

**Why:** Different competitions have different rules - app needs flexibility.

### 4. Enhanced Mobile Experience ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Create the best possible mobile/PWA experience with great touch interactions.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add haptic feedback for all counter interactions (increment/decrement)
- [ ] Implement touch gestures (swipe to increment/decrement)
- [ ] Optimize button sizes for touch (minimum 44px targets)
- [ ] Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- [ ] Optimize for landscape mode (better participant grid)
- [ ] Prevent accidental zoom/scroll during active competitions
- [ ] Add PWA manifest for "Add to Home Screen"

**Why:** Mobile-first experience with haptic feedback makes interactions feel responsive and fun.

## **Phase 2: User Experience Improvements**

### 1. Reset All Button üü† **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Goal:** Let users instantly reset all counters to zero while keeping the participant list, ready for a new round.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add "Reset All" button component, visible when participants exist
- [ ] Reset all participant counts to 0 and clear penalties instantly
- [ ] Add visual feedback and smooth animations
- [ ] Include in undo history for safety

**Why:** Fast restarts between rounds, avoids the hassle of re-adding users.

### 3. Edit Participant Names

**Goal:** Allow users to quickly edit names in case of typos or updates.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add edit icon/button next to each participant name
- [ ] Implement inline editing with input field on click
- [ ] Handle save on Enter/blur and cancel on Escape
- [ ] Add input validation and character limits

**Why:** Improves usability and reduces friction from user mistakes.

### 4. Undo Last Action

**Goal:** Let users revert their last change (counter update, penalty toggle, participant add/remove, reset).

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Implement history stack to store previous states
- [ ] Add state snapshots before each modification
- [ ] Create "Undo" button with proper disable/enable logic
- [ ] Limit history size for memory efficiency

**Why:** Makes the app forgiving, reduces frustration from misclicks or mistakes.

**Implementation Steps:**
- [ ] Add theme context and toggle button
- [ ] Create dark mode color scheme
- [ ] Persist theme preference in localStorage
- [ ] Update Tailwind classes for theme switching

### 6. Participant Avatars/Emojis
